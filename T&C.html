        <section class="bindingarbitration" id="bindingarbitration">
            <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>

            Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms, including any question regarding its
            existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International
            Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146)
            according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of
            this clause. The number of arbitrators shall be 2. The language of the proceedings shall be English. The
            governing law of these Legal Terms shall be substantive law of cyber security.

            <br>
            <h3>Restrictions</h3>

            <br>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
            To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
            is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
            procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
            representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

            <br>
            <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>

            <br>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
            informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
            validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising
            from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
            injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect
            to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable
            and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
            jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

            Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or
            enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
            provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of
            our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,

            of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
